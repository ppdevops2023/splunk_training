1. Supported Datatypes in collections.conf:  number | bool | string | time

2. Accelerated fields have a limitation of 1024 bytes per entry, so you cannot use fields that have more than 1024 bytes.

3. Lookup configurations can reference fields that are added to events by field extractions, field aliases, and calculated fields. They cannot reference event types and tags.
